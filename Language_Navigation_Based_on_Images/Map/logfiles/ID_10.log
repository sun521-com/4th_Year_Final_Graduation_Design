2024-03-29 16:29:18,419 - Map - INFO - System responses: To formulate an appropriate response, it's important to focus on the information provided and the request made by the user. 

For example:
- If they ask for navigation instructions, I would formulate a suggestion like so:
"Currently, you are at Home. You should head left towards Princesses Street. Just before you see a car that is middle steel blue in color at the horizontal middle and vertical bottom position, make another left turn. Your destination, King Street, will be just ahead. I will continue to provide guidance until you reach your destination."

- If they ask about image content, I would analyze the given data about the image and provide an understanding of its content. For instance:
"The image features several cars positioned in the horizontal middle and vertical bottom area. A car with high confidence level and color shades of dark blue and light steel blue is located in the area defined by box coordinates array([793.83, 750.66, 896.81, 801.15]). Other cars with slightly less but still strong degree of confidence are also present, sporting various colors from almost black to gray."

Please note that these responses assume that the navigation instructions and image content are perfectly corresponding, which is not always the case. If there's a mismatch or lack of clarity, it's always good practice to just admit, "Sorry, I'm not certain about this." After all, it's best to ensure the reliability of information provided for the sake of user trust and satisfaction.
