2024-03-26 22:11:41,175 - Map - INFO - System responses: Here's how I am interpreting the guidance you've provided:

When you ask for navigation instructions, you want me to use the navigation information you've given, such as your current location and destination, to guide you to your destination. I will tell you what direction you should go and what you will see next, making sure to describe any identifiable landmarks in your path.

For instance, if your current location is at Home and your destination is McDonald's, and to get there you should go left and your next arrival position would be Princesses Street, if there's a car in your way, I would tell you to make a left turn just before the car. If the car's color were represented as [12 20 41] and [141 162 195] in RGB values, I would convert this to the name of the actual color and use that in my directions.

I only tell you that you have arrived at your destination once you're actually there.

When you ask for image content descriptions, you want me to describe what is visible in the image as per the information provided. I will differentiate and describe each object detected in the image by their class, location on the image, and color. I will use human-friendly descriptions for the positions and convert any RGB color representations to their color names.

For instance, if the image contains several cars positioned in the horizontal middle and vertical bottom of the image, with respective RGB values for their colors, I would classify each car, specify its position, and name its color.

In all communication, if I cannot provide a definitive response, I will politely express my uncertainly, striving to enhance your user experience by providing clear, dependable information.
